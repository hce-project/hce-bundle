Universal App - Designed for iPhone and iPad
Things are about to get chilly in Arcane Legends. The Battle of Nordr expansion is now available and tells the story of the warrior’s frozen homeland. Players will witness new cold weather monsters, items and pets. Also, the level cap has been raised by 5 levels, letting hardcore players hit level 31. Note: you may not see the update in the App Store description, but the developers say that the update is live, and will update in-app. Give it a shot and let us know what you think.

 <bodys><![CDATA[If you’re just starting out in web development or coding (like for WP themes) you know you need good tools to do the job. You’ve also figured out that there are a lot of great free tools you can start with, but free is only going to get you so far.
I was in the same boat years ago. I started with free BBEdit (back in the pre-OS X days folks), then bought the full version. Moving to OS X a few years ago (and a decade plus after starting web dev), I picked up free text and graphic editors and then… So you get the idea. We’ve got a web dev bundle for you to take a look at—The Web Dev Power Pack Bundle: Get Three Mac Apps + 1,001 Design Assets That Will Turn You Into a Master Web Developer—and it might have the tools you need.

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧design, ∧mobile∧operating∧systems, ∧mobile∧platforms, ∧products, ∧tablet∧computers NutriAidGad LevyHealth & Fitness$ 0.99DownloadNutriAid is an iPhone app developed by Gad Levy. Whether you’re trying to shed a few pounds, or just want to experiment with a more heart-healthy diet, NutriAid can help you to monitor what you eat.iPhone apps that monitor your exercise or what you choose to eat each day are quite common on the App Store these days. So, what is it that separates NutriAid from the competition?One thing that is really nice is NutriAid’s display system. Forget the bars and graphs of other diet apps. In NutriAid, your remaining calories for the day are displayed as outlined icons. As you eat throughout the day, you can see these icons fill up.Unlike calorie-focused apps, this “icon” approach makes it really simple to see just how much more food you are allowed to consume during the day, and what types of foods you need to eat more of.I also love the built-in “snack alarm” function. It is perfect for reminding yourself to eat a small, healthy snack, in order to keep your metabolism up and your blood sugar relatively level throughout the course of the entire day.The app also customizes itself based on your responses to a survey about your favorite foods. However, some of these food groupings seem a little off: cheese is grouped with meats (it’s not THAT high in protein!), while beans are classified as grains (despite being very high in protein!)There are some quality issues. The app is riddled with typos, and the overall design could use a bit of a polish to make it feel more luxurious and trustworthy. It’s a fine looking app, but it could use a bit of sprucing up.All that being said, if you want an approach to dieting that is less calorie-crazy and more focused on responsible serving sizes and eating a varied diet, NutriAid is worth checking out!NutriAid is compatible with iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. Requires iOS 4.3 or later. This app is optimized for iPhone 5. Developer disclaimer: If you are under 16, pregnant or have any health problems this application is not for you. Consult a doctor before embarking on any weight loss program.The post NutriAid iPhone App Review: Track Your Food and Lose Weight appeared first on Tapscape.]]></bodys>

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧games By now you’ve no doubt discovered how overpowered the two-way rail gun is in the 16-bit version of Borderlands and, as a consequence, found that the game doesn’t seem to ever end. If you are tired of that marketing game, but still in the mood for more Borderlands goodness, Gearbox has, once again, got you covered.
The latest trailer for Borderlands 2 features Sir Hammerlock narrating some of the finer points of the world and characters found in the game. The various regions of Pandora are shown, which all seem quite different and imaginative. The player characters and their play styles are demonstrated, with a few new powers displayed as well. There is also some talk about the huge variety of guns in the game, but that’s a topic that has already been thoroughly covered in earlier trailers.
Check it out below, and know that it probably won’t be the last we’ll hear from Gearbox before the Borderlands 2 release, which is only two weeks away on September 18.]]></bodys>

For your weekend reading, here’s a recap of five noteworthy stories that appeared on Data Center Knowledge this past week. Enjoy!
Facebook Decloaks, Confirms Plans for Iowa Server Farm – It’s official: Facebook will build a massive data center in Altoona, Iowa. After a year of secret scouting missions, the social network today decloaked and confirmed its plans to invest $299.5 million to build the first phase of a three-building campus in Altoona, a suburb of Des Moines. Facebook says the 476,000 square foot building will be the world’s longest data center, providing the company with a digital beachhead in the middle of the U.S.
Google’s Infrastructure Boom Continues: Expansion Ahead in Oregon – The scope and acceleration of Google’s data center construction program makes it clear that the company sees massive growth ahead in its Internet businesses. Google’s 2013 building boom represents the largest investment in data center infrastructure in the history of the Internet.
Companies Gobbling Up Turn-Key Data Center Space – Data center users have leased more than 400,000 square feet of turn-key data center space in recent months, according to a new market survey from real estate firm Avison Young. Despite that strong activity, the market for wholesale data center space continues to face a potential oversupply, the report said, with more than 1.9 million square feet of space available.
Digital Realty Boosts Connectivity at its Data Center Hubs – Digital Realty will build dark fiber infrastructure to connect its key Internet gateways and data center buildings, making it easier and cheaper for customers to connect with the carriers and clouds of their choice.
T5 Plans $800 Million Campus in Colorado Springs – T5 Data Centers has unveiled plans for an $800 million data center campus in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The project marks a major step forward in Colorado Springs’ ambitions as a data center destination, and continues a steady expansion by Atlanta-based T5.&gt;

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧applications, ∧cities∧by∧GDP, ∧companies, ∧dic∧events, ∧it∧people, ∧search∧engines, ∧social∧network∧sites, ∧web∧services He's built a career out of creating new projects, and now he's set his sights on something new. Tell us what you think he's up toBiz Stone, the 39-year-old blogging pioneer and co-founder of Twitter, has announced plans for a new startup. It's called Jelly, but beyond that, the rest is mostly a mystery. Stone's announcement, posted on JellyHQ.com and his Twitter account, was short and mysterious, and left the tech world guessing what was up the mogul's sleeve: People are basically good – when provided a tool that helps them do good in the world, they prove it.Stone, whose prolific activity in the startup world most recently saw him joining Buzzfeed's Jonah Peretti and Twitter co-founder Evan Williams as advisors of discussion startup Branch, revealed little else but that the tool would be free, mobile-first and not ready for "a while." We know little about what Jelly will do – and bloggers are taking their guesses – but tell us: what else should Jelly do?Check out this timeline of Stone's contributions to the world of blogging, technology and social media and tell us what you'd like to see next. 1999: Joins blogging startup Xanga as creative directorUser name? Genius. Modest. After the advent of other blog sites like Tumblr and Blogger, the latter of which is why Stone decamped to Google, Xanga is now the 5,166th most-visited site on the Internet. 2003: joins Google as a senior specialistArguably the most mainstream company Stone has joined (other than the one he co-created), Stone further developed blogging platform Blogger after it was acquired by Google. 2006: launches Odeo"We just launched a new site called Hellodeo.com which makes it easy to record webcam video and grab the code for pasting into xanga or whatevah," Stone wrote on his Xanga blog. Odeo was sold in 2007, and the service suspended itself in 2010. 2006: co-creates Twitter"I'm spending time working on Twitter.com these days," Stone wrote on his Xanga blog shortly after launching the service that would change the way people around the world communicated. Years later, Stone would tell people at a conference in Montreal that users shouldn't spend too much time on the social networking site. Present day: investing and advising in everythingOver the past few years, Stone has been spreading his knowledge of the startup world to all corners of the internet. He's invested in Viddy, Square and Intercom and served as adviser to DonersChoose.org, Plinky.com and Fluther.Stone also found time to co-found The Obvious Corporation, which is billed as a company that develops "systems and mechanisms that help people work together to improve the world". Sounds like Jelly could be a tool for do-gooders on the go. It wouldn't be the first time a startup mogul launched a site in the name of social activism, but it could be the first of its kind to succeed – Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes launched Jumo to match potential donors to charity organizations, but the launch was rocky and the company was eventually acquired by GOOD. Present day: vague Jelly announcementSo, what should Jelly do?

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧applications, ∧cities∧by∧GDP, ∧companies, ∧dic∧events, ∧mobile∧operating∧systems, ∧products, ∧search∧engines, ∧social∧network∧sites, ∧video∧hosting∧services Venice, CA-based Laffster today announced the release of its political satire and humor discovery app, Mock the Vote, and the closing of a $750,000 seed round funding from Greylock Partners, Howard Lindzon of StockTwits, and Adam Nash, former VP at LinkedIn, among other angel investors. The company wants to help people discover online comedic content as easily as they would music, wanting to be for online humour what Pandora and Songza are for music. It plans to use the funding to build out its team and continue to develop the platform with the help of researchers from its institute partners Dartmouth and UC Boulder. It is also a graduate of the Santa Monica-based startup accelerator MuckerLab.
The company was founded by Dan Altmann, formerly at CollegeHumor’s parent company InterActive Corp, Eric Posen, and Geoff Plitt, a former Google engineer who also performs as a standup comedian. “I spent some time studying this massive nature of people wanting humor online, it’s more than 50 percent of all videos watched, it overtook news as of 2010 online, and really saw this massive market but because of the nature of what was going on, you had to go 10 different sites to find one piece of comedic content,” Altmann said in an interview. “We wanted to take what we saw as actively scattered even within YouTube and really put some sophistication and technology behind it, in ways that music has had for years.”
The launch of its Mock the Vote app is the first project for the company, and aims to leverage its comedic content discovery algorithm and API. The app categorizes humorous content by political leaning and allows users to pick a side, or stay neutral. It will include original content from partners like Maker Studios, The New Yorker’s cartoon desk in addition to curated satirical content from Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Saturday Night Live and The Onion. “One in three of Americans 40 and younger see satirical sources as replacements to traditional news. We wanted to take that idea and apply it with our technology through a very simple and easy to use application,” Altmann added.
The app is free to download with the company focused on gaining traction and building out their user acquisition strategy, however it sees a variety of monetization opportunities in content sponsorship and advertising by virtue of their strategic partnerships and content licensing agreements that would give the company the ability to tap into their audiences.
Discovery is the word of the hour, with every brand, content creator, and consumer looking to have a wide assortment of ways to have content framed in a manner that’s easy to access. In terms of video discovery, recently companies like fliqq have launched to help users get together with friends to share videos, not to mention Pinterest-style video discovery tool Chill which enables users to discover videos according to genres and includes a ‘funny’ category, not to mention sites like MovieClip or AnyClip let let users browse video clips via a variety of filters. However, Laffster sees itself more as a backend technology provider that can be applied to any form of online comedic content.
“We started working with different production companies as well as traditional rights holders at movie studios to show how we can take traditional catalogues or constantly-updated portfolios of content and drive more views to them,” Altmann said. “We’ve done some tests and different kind of outreach with content on our own Laffster.com property and YouTube and we’ve shown that users who discover content in an easier way watch more, so our goal in the future is how to get users to watch more video and not have to jump to ten different platforms.”
The company views its own apps as a testing ground for its backend technology and hopes to enable other third-party platforms to leverage its API to enable better content discovery on their sites. It will also be looking to launch an Android version of its Mock the Vote app, and iterate on its offerings based on user feedback. Laffster recognizes that its technology could also be leveraged for other genres of content, but will have to prove itself in driving views for online comedic content first before testing new waters.]]></bodys>

Yeah, neither do we. But in any case, the biggest and relatively baddest of those phones will be available on Sprint subsidiary Boost Mobile sometime in the near future, under the new alias of the LG Venice. EV Leaks got a hold of an official photo of the device – we’ve only got their word that it’s coming to Boost, but they’re usually spot-on with this sort of thing.

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧applications, ∧mobile∧operating∧systems, ∧mobile∧platforms, ∧products, ∧social∧network∧sites, ∧tablet∧computers, ∧web∧services Twitter doesn’t want just anyone to develop and maintain third-party apps. Because of this, the social network has implemented API keys that limit the number of people that can use apps such as Tweetbot, Twitterrific, and many others.
However, Twitter has never followed these rules when it comes to their own apps. While this has always been known, the API keys and secrets Twitter has used to override their restrictions have not — until now, of course.
The codes that Twitter uses for their own apps have now been leaked on GitHub. These codes, which take the form of a consumer key and consumer secret, act like a username and password.
As The Next Web first recognized, Twitter has a choice to make now that the codes have surfaced.
First, they can replace the codes with new ones so that third-party developers can’t use them. However, this would become little more than a “long cat and mouse game.”
Second, they could loosen up the restrictions, which is probably a choice that they’d never make. Or they could completely shut down third-party access to their API.
The choice Twitter makes could prove significant.
Since Twitter first implemented restrictions, some companies have been forced to raise the price for the apps they create. A good example is Tapbots, which is still developing quality applications, but offers them at higher prices. The reason is so that they don’t exhaust the number of keys available to them.
The company’s Tweetbot for Mac application, for example, is currently priced at $19.99 in the Mac App Store. Tapbots charges $2.99 for their separate iOS apps for the iPhone/iPod touch, and iPad.
I’d hate to see third-party Twitter apps go away. However, I also recognize that Twitter has no obligation to keep providing their API to other developers.
My hope is that Twitter will make a decision that is best for the consumer. However, I haven’t a clue what that decision should be.
Do you have any ideas?

In fact since reporting on issues related to the Hotmail-to-Outlook.com changeover in early January, there’s been a fairly steady flow of complaints from users about inaccessible or only partly operative email. Much of that time, the Microsoft status page showed no issue but on Tuesday night it lit up like a Christmas tree. There was another public flare up of problems at the end of February. At that time, a Microsoft spokeswoman explained that when a small number of users are affected the status page will not show a problem. Issues that impact a significant number of customers, on the other hand, “will be noted and visible on the server status page.” #hotmail and #outlook have been down since 2:35pm PDT.

&nbsp;
Alibaba confirmed the rumor that it would roll out online shopping credit service, called “Credit Payment”, to users on Taobao and Tmall as soon as in the upcoming April. The service will be provided by Alipay, the payments service under Alibaba Group.
Credit limit, between 200 yuan ($ 32) to 5,000 yuan ($ 800), will be decided with algorithms based on user data, such as ratings given by sellers and purchase history. Interest free periods are up to 38 days. It is reported that 80 million Alipay users are qualified to apply for it.
The service will charge Taobao or Tmall merchants who join in the program 1% of payments (currently 0.8% as a discount), similar to the level with credit cards. Over 1.3 million merchants have already been qualified and can get on board whenever they’d like to. A logo signaling it will be shown on the webpages of merchants’ stores then.
It will first be available with mobile apps — nice move for promoting mobile payments and mobile shopping.
In general it must boost purchases given a majority of Chinese don’t own physical credit cards. Also the application process is easier for users since it’s based on existing data that they don’t have to provide with detailed information required by banks and wait on shipping.
The only inconvenience? You can only use the credit to shop on Alibaba’s properties — of course, it may not be an issue for most users as Alibaba’s cover almost all goods you can think of on earth.
The user data and historical purchases are what conventional banks don’t have to leverage purchasing power to the full. What’s more, Alipay will accumulate users’ credit history along the way after the service launches. For now, only Chinese central bank has the credit history of credit card holders — again, only a minority of Chinese consumers ever own physical credit cards.
Alibaba won’t take care of the credit with its own funds but through banks; for one thing, it’s not authorized to offer such a service. On the other hand, the company doesn’t have to worry about bad credit. For this ever-new business, it’s unclear what a regulatory process is needed. It is generally believed Alibaba has got approval from authorities as it’s not the first time it came up with such a unprecedented solution for online shopping. Years back, the company came up with the idea of holding up consumers’ payments till they confirm of receiving the goods to dissolve users’ disbelief in buying anything through the Internet without seeing a seller in flesh.
Some Chinese banks are working on “virtual” credit card. The China Merchants Bank, partnering with China Mobile the carrier, is to enable mobile devices to do whatever a plastic credit card can do. Alipay, however, said that they’d not go any further than offering consumer credit for online shopping, although its parent company launched an e-credit card for small businesses years back.
But apparently Alibaba’s ambitions on finance are going further with its newly restructured finance arm. The company expanded its micro-loan program to Guang Dong where are also crowded with small businesses last month. Zhong An, an online insurance company, will be established together with Ping An, one of the leading insurance companies in China, and Tencent, an Internet giant with huge amount of users, with Alibaba taking a 19.9% stake in the company.

 <bodys><![CDATA[You may wonder why we would be talking about the new Star Trek movie; well it seems as though Audi has done yet another fantastic tie-in, and this time with Star Trek Into Darkness.
Audi’s new Star Trek Into Darkness commercial is a very funny tie-in featuring the two Spocks, Leonard Nimoy and Zachary Quinto. In the video the old and new just wants to outdo each other all the time, and after being beaten by their latest competition, Quinto suggests a race to the golf course.
Nimoy is driving a Mercedes, while Quinto is behind the wheel of the Audi. It’s clear from the start that the Audi has the edge, although this was obvious considering it’s their commercial.
The new Spock wins the contest, but there was a funny moment towards the end, when Nimoy puts his arm around Quinto and performs the Vulcan neck pinch, which sees him fall to the ground.
The final scene is the pivotal part of the commercial, as it shows an Audi driving itself away, showing that the Audi is better than the both of them. This new Star Trek Into Darkness and Audi tie-in is nothing new, as the German car manufacturer already has a huge presence in the Iron Man movies, and more so in the latest one, Iron Man 3.
What’s the best part of this new commercial?]]></bodys>

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧cities∧by∧GDP, ∧companies, ∧computer∧hardware∧manufacturers, ∧computer∧system∧manufacturers, ∧dic∧events, ∧laptop∧brands∧and∧manufacturers, ∧mobile∧platforms Yesterday startup accelerator TechStars held its third demo day in Seattle, and 10 companies presented after participating in the 3-month program. One of those companies was MobileDevHQ, a startup that wants to rethink the way developers and companies get their apps found in the Apple App Store and Google Play marketplace. The company offers app store optimization, starting with helping marketers optimize their apps for search.
Co-founder Ian Sefferman originally started working on consumer app discovery with a company called AppStoreHQ, helping people find apps in the App Store. He found they were getting requests from developers and marketers asking how they could promote their apps and get found in the Apple App Store and Google Play marketplace. “It took us literally about two and a half years of getting hit over the head with requests like this before we said ‘oh hey, we actually have a lot of data, we could flip that data on its head and expose it to the app marketers,’” Sefferman said.
They rebranded and decided to first focus on app store search, helping companies understand what keywords they should include in their descriptions and titles in order to get found by potential customers, something Sefferman refers to as search engine optimization (SEO) for apps. ”We believe that on the developer and marketer side, there’s a whole lot of money being spent in paid app distribution,” Sefferman said, everything from banner ads to incentivized app downloads. “There’s no real resources for marketers on the organic app distribution side…longer term the vision is really be that single dashboard for an app marketer to understand all of organic app distribution, and we started with search.”
MobileDevHQ charges on a monthly subscription basis, and pricing is based on the number of reports users want to run, from $14 per month for one report, up to $149 per month for 50 reports. Marketers get started by sending MobileDevHQ the app they want to track, a list of their competitors’ apps, and then the company does an audit similar to what HubSpot would do for a website, outlining what they’re ranking well for now, and the things they could change to positively affect their app store ranking.
Marketers get a report outlining everything from the keywords they should be ranking for, the search terms by relevancy, difficulty, and volume, for example telling a recipe app that it will be difficult to rank for the word “recipe” since lots of other apps are also using that term. They also get ongoing reports showing how they’re ranking vs. their competitors over time. It’s then up to customers to change their descriptions, titles and other app marketing materials; MobileDevHQ just provides the recommendations.
MobileDevHQ originally launched its tool in March, was cashflow positive by the time it entered the TechStars program, and is now looking to raise a round of funding. Sefferman said next they’ll be looking to help marketers with PR, outlining which journalists write about different categories of apps. And while right now they only work with marketers who have an app available, eventually they’ll look to provide competitive intelligence to marketers before they build their apps to help them understand the opportunity.
App store optimization is a new area of SEO, and while MobileDevHQ might be one of the only companies tackling it right now, along with competitors like AppCod.es, there’s nothing stopping existing SEO giants like SEOmoz from branching out to app store optimization down the line. Making sure they expand from just search will be the key to success, and potentially partnering with a web-focused SEO company to offer its services to clients with mobile requests.

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧dic∧events The information age has transformed the landscape of journalism.
For better or for worse, journalists, and the people who employ
journalists, no longer need to always have full-time eyes, ears and
boots on the ground. Newsrooms are experiencing bone-deep cuts in
staffing, and smartphone equipped members of the public are now
usually the first on the scene of breaking-news stories.&nbsp;
Amid this whirlwind of change, two visions for the future of
journalism have been recently unveiled. One, Newsmodo, is a
marketplace for professional freelancer journalists to sell their
content to media organisations. The other, Guardian Witness is an
"open journalism" platform for readers to have dialogue with the
Guardian and contribute to stories and investigations.

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧applications, ∧companies, ∧mobile∧operating∧systems, ∧products PassWallet, an app that allows Android devices to use passes created for Apple’s Passbook service, has been updated to add supper for NFC. Users can now “beam and redeem” all kinds of passes if they have a supported handset, something Apple’s iOS devices — which don’t support NFC — cannot do. PassWallet was created by Attido to allow Android and BlackBerry users to take advantage of Passbook files developed for iOS. Apple’s service lets users turn their coupons, tickets, loyalty cards and more into digital .pkpass files, which negate the need to carry a physical copy in their wallet. Now Attido has teamed up with Skycore, the developers behind CodeReadr, a nifty barcode scanner, to add NFC beaming to its application. “Passes stored within PassWallet normally present pass IDs as barcodes for scanning but can now also beam pass IDs via NFC and have those IDs validated and redeemed with the CodeReadr app on NFC-enabled Android devices,” the partners told NFC World. “Apple created the Passbook standard for card, coupon and ticket delivery to iOS devices. My team built PassWallet to fill the gap for the Android platform,” Attido’s Andy Nugent said. “We then expanded the technology to support NFC redemption on Android through our partnership with the CodeReadr team.” Skycore CEO Rich Eicher believes that the new functionality has the potential to offer a “fast, secure and seamless tap-to-validate process for passes,” one that could greatly improve the functionality of service like Passbook. To prove it, Skycore has created a video that shows the feature in action. Apple iPhone is over five years old now, and the company continues to shun NFC technology. Passbook has been designed to work without it, but Attido and Skycore are proving how much better it could be if NFC was supported. And this is just a basic example — imagine how NFC could enhance Passbook if Apple got behind it.

The Open Compute Project was launched last year to bring standards and repeatable designs to IT infrastructure, and has been gaining traction as more hardware vendors join the effort. Facebook's move to open its designs has been a welcome departure from the historic secrecy surrounding data center design and operations. But energy-saving customizations that work in Facebook's data centers present challenges in multi-tenant facilities. To make it work, Facebook hacked a rack and gave up some energy savings by using standard 208V power."

These include the Istanbul Modern Art Museum, Art Gallery Of South Australia, Museum of Palazzo Vecchio, and Princeton University, to name a few. In addition to the new art, Google has added some new features to the Art Project experience. There is a new “Compare” button on the toolbar on the left of the screen for each painting. “This allows you to examine two pieces of artwork side-by-side to look at how an artist’s style evolved over time, connect trends across cultures or delve deeply into two parts of the same work,” explains Piotr Adamczyk from Google Art Project.
They’ve also added a Hangout app:
Google says it now has 35,000 objects online, and that nearly 180 partners have contributed works to the Art Project. Over 300,000 people have created their own galleries, and over 15 million visitors have gone to the Project since its April launch. View The Google Art Project here.]]></bodys>

In iOS 6, Apple has finally made it easier and more intuitive to add a photo or a video to an email in the Mail app. You can use this new direct insert method to email more than 5 photos/videos, which is still one of the weird limitations if you want to send multiple photos via the Camera roll in iOS 6.

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧companies, ∧countries, ∧design, ∧laptop∧brands∧and∧manufacturers, ∧products, ∧wireless∧data∧standards LTE is coming to T-Mobile USA in selected markets, and January T-Mobile told Engadget the Nokia Lumia 810 will be getting an firmware upgrade to support the technology at some point.
While the Nokia Lumia 810 is a nice enough handset, it is not the best specified Windows Phone on T-Mobile USA. That honour goes to the HTC 8X, but is seems buyers of that device will be left out of the LTE party.
WPDaily enquired from T-Mobile and received the following reply:
The Lumia 810 is the only other LTE-capable device on T-Mobile aside from the Note II, and we will share timing of that LTE MR at a later time. Please stay tuned.
The reason is likely related to Nokia’s radio expertise, which allows them to support a wide variety of frequencies with one chipset.
As WPDaily notes, the news is a nice boost for existing owners of the NL 810, but of course does leave new buyers in a bind - Buy an HTC 8X for its nice design, thin profile and very good HD screen, or buy a lower specced and frankly less attractively designed Nokia Lumia 810 for the coming high speed network support.
Which one would our readers chose? Let us know below.

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧cities∧by∧GDP, ∧software∧development While Shadowrun Returns was an unequivocal Kickstarter success purely on the strength of the license, one of the campaign’s initial selling points was the “chicken in every pot” claim that every reward tier will include a DRM-free copy of the game. However, due to licensing issues, the developer won’t be able to keep its promise of DRM-free content past the first bit of DLC, the Berlin Campaign.

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧companies, ∧countries, ∧mobile∧operating∧systems, ∧products, ∧web∧services Sony Xperia S Jelly Bean Update Gets a Scare is a post by Adam Mills from Gotta Be Mobile.The Sony Xperia S Android 4.1 Jelly Bean update, which Sony has promised by the end of May, took a bit of a turn today with a Sony Mobile employee hinting that while the update could definitely still roll out in May, there is a chance that it could arrive in June.
In April, Sony confirmed several Android 4.1 Jelly Bean updates for the end of June including the Sony Xperia Ion update and the long-awaited Sony Xperia S Android 4.1 Jelly Bean update. The company did not give out any specifics in terms of dates, only stating that the software would land by the end of May.
Up until today, all signs pointed to that certainly being the case. However, a Sony Mobile employee from Russia has now thrown some doubt behind the update’s arrival.
Read: Sony Xperia S Jelly Bean Roll Out Inches Closer.
The Sony Xperia S Jelly Bean update is in flux, it seems.
In a series of tweets, first discovered by XperiaBlog, Sony Mobile Russia employee Dmitry Lazarev says that the Sony Xperia S Jelly Bean update may not land until the second half of June. It’s not clear if he is referring to the update’s arrival in Russia or the update’s arrival on the whole. He goes on to add though that there is “no reason for the delay” and that the “firmware is actually ready and actively tested.”
Furthermore, he claims that the software could role out earlier than his June proclamation. So, at this point, while this is certainly a scare for Sony Xperia S owners, it’s not confirmation of a delay. In fact, it’s still possible that the update will roll out in May, even for those that are in possession of a Sony Xperia S in Russia.
Keep in mind, we also saw a number of Sony employees make proclamations about the release of the Sony Xperia S Jelly Bean update, only to see them fall flat on their face. So at this point, we still expect the Sony Xperia S update to roll out as planned, sometime before the end of May.
At that point, unbranded users should get their upgrade with users on specific carriers following in the weeks after. Carriers have yet to issue specific release dates for the roll outs and we don’t expect to see those emerge until after the roll out begins.Sony Xperia S Jelly Bean Update Gets a Scare is a post by Adam Mills from Gotta Be Mobile.]]></bodys>

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧cities∧by∧GDP, ∧companies, ∧computer∧hardware∧manufacturers, ∧countries, ∧design, ∧dic∧events, ∧games, ∧products Since the Xbox One has been revealed already, it’s not surprising that gamers would start wondering about what games would appear on the console. A rumour that has just surfaced revolved around Dragon Age 3: Inquisition coming to Microsoft’s next-gen console. The rumours started when a European retailer listed the game for the Xbox One and in typical fashion, was quickly removed.
The Dragon Age 3 listing surfaced on Amazon Italy, following on the heels of two separate leaks about another game, Mirror’s Edge 2, that also involved Amazon’s European branches. However, the listing for Dragon Age 3 is a little different since the game was already unveiled last year.
Bioware and EA have been keeping mum about Dragon Age 3 but some tantalizing morsels of information about it were dropped here and there. The game is reported to mime the open-ended design of The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim and will showcase a new hero. New additions to the game will be a new customization palette and the ability to take over control of castles. Inquisition is also said to be more extensive than other Bioware games.
Dragon Age 3: Inquisition will run on the new Frostbite 3 graphics engine. The highly regarded system is compatible with various consoles like the Xbox One, the Xbox 360, the PC, PS3 and the PS4.
EA is expected to provide more information about Dragon Age 3: Inquisition at the upcoming Electronic Entertainment Expo which will be held in Los Angeles.]]></bodys>

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧cities∧by∧GDP, ∧countries Anjali Rao
A former CNN presenter has signed on to be the host of SBS’s Dateline.
Anjali Rao will anchor the network’s flagship current affairs program as of next Tuesday.
Rao worked at CNN International hosting both the weekday breakfast program and Talk Asia, a weekly magazine style show about Asia.
Prior to CNN, Rao worked as an anchor on both Sky News and Channel 5 News in London. Rao was also formerly a reporter and producer for Seven News in Melbourne.
Paul Cutler, SBS director of news and current affairs said: “Anjali is a unique and exceptionally talented journalist and presenter. She comes to Dateline with a wealth of experience from around the world and is a great fit for SBS. We’re delighted to have her on board.”
Rao said: “Dateline has a unique approach, delivering honest and compelling journalism covering important stories from around the world that many others would not. To have the opportunity to be a part of such a distinguished program, and follow in the footsteps of some of Australia’s most respected journalists, is incredibly exciting.”
In November, Rao guest hosted 2UE’s Morning show with Ian ‘Dicko’ Dickson.

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧applications, ∧dic∧events, ∧laptop∧brands∧and∧manufacturers, ∧products, ∧social∧network∧sites Instagram on Thursday reminded all its users that today is the day its new “Photos of You” section is being turned on for everyone. This means everyone who can currently see your profile is now able to see all the pictures that you have been tagged in.
The feature was first announced two weeks ago but was only available if you chose to opt-in. Now it’s available for everyone, but thankfully you can choose whether photos others add of you appear on your profile automatically or only once you select them. If you don’t want pictures of you to show up automatically, turn on the option to manually select which photos appear on your profile by following these three steps:
Go to your profile and tap the icon for all photos you’re tagged in.
Tap the Android menu icon or the iPhone wrench icon in the top-right corner.
Tap “Add Manually.”
These instructions remind us that Instagram is still not available for Windows Phone nor BlackBerry. We still think this will change in the coming months, as bringing in more potential users is always more important than adding incremental features like this one:
The new “Photos of You” section is clearly influenced by Facebook, Instagram’s parent company. The world’s largest social network has been keeping track of photos people are tagged in for years. On Instagram though, only the taker of a photo is able to tag people in it, unlike on Facebook where other people can suggest tags of themselves or others.
It’s also one of those features that will be useful whenever Instagram finally decides to offer a full-blown website. There needs to be more on those large screens than just photos and ads.

Today’s report came from Chinese news website yicai.com and was translated by BrightWire:
Apple has registered three firms in three buildings in Pudong, Shanghai, and one of them will be dedicated to procurement management and R&amp;D, according to documents on the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce’s website.

 <bodys><![CDATA[Now that the winter months are in full swing, this is a great time to sort through some of your winter gear. There’s likely to be a few items that you use a lot along with others that you hardly use anymore. Get everyone who lives in your home involved (if possible) so that they can select their favorites and identify items that can be donated to charity.
As you go through each area of you home, remember to look inside closets, under bed storage bins, the attic, the basement, your garage or shed, and any other areas that the following items may be hiding:
Coats and jackets. Chances are, you reach for the same one or two pieces of outerwear all the time. And, that’s okay. We all have our favorites. Consider donating the ones that no longer fit (or that you don’t like) to One Warm Coat or a local homeless shelter or another charity wanting outerwear. Winter is the best time to donate these items so they can be used.
Hats, scarves, and gloves. If they don’t fit you anymore (whether in size or style), it’s time to pass on your hats and other winter accessories to others who will put them to good use. Check for winter clothing drives hosted by schools, community centers, or houses of worship in your neighborhood.
Footwear. Consider donating the boots you no longer wear to Goodwill or Soles4Souls. Both organizations will accept shoes that are new or gently worn. If you have athletic shoes that are in disrepair, send them off to the Nike ReUse a Shoe program to be recycled.
Sporting gear. If you have winter sports gear that you no longer want, participate in a ski swap to let go of your old winter sport gear (contact the ski resort you go to or local sporting goods shop). Your skis, sleds, snow boards, goggles, helmets, and other winter sport stuff that you no longer use can also be repurposed or recylced. Check out the recycling program at Snow Sport Industries of America, where items are disassembled and repurposed by other industries. Or, you can let Green Mountain Ski Furniture help you transform your old skis into something new, like tables, adirondack chairs, coat racks, and more. This might be a good option for junior skis.
Blankets and sheets. You probably have a few blankets and flannel sheets that don’t fit the beds in your home that you can donate to a homeless, family, or pet shelter. Art for Humanity, located in Virginia, will allow you to drop off or mail used sheets (as well as towels and shoes) that are in good condition.
Pet gear. Does your dog really love wearing that winter coat and matching boots? And, do you have enough room to store them? Check with your local veterinarian, SPCA, or animal rescue to see if they have a need for those items and other unused pet supplies.

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧companies, ∧dic∧events, ∧games If you’re an Xbox 360 gamer, you’re familiar with updates that add new features and make changes to your game console. Microsoft has announced that a new Xbox system update is rolling out to gamers around the world starting today. The new update is mandatory and it’s unclear exactly how large the update is at this time.
Major Nelson reports that any Xbox 360 owner who is already signed into LIVE will be forced to sign out to apply the update. The update reportedly corrects some issues with the Xbox 360 that some gamers have been suffering from. One of the issues addressed with the update is a problem some have seen with the display an incorrect playlist from Xbox SmartGlass.
The update will also address an error with Xbox Video closed-captioning. The final major issue that this mandatory update will address is a problem some users have had with Xbox Music. Users will have to accept the update and apply it to be able to get back online.
We’ve also had some other interesting Xbox 360 news this week. Yesterday we mentioned that the ship dates for Halo 4 map packs were leaked. The three map packs are called Crimson, Majestic, and Castle and will release on December 10, February 25, and April 1 respectively.

Attention all: we’ve come to the brink, to the edge, to the precipice. Much-adored microblogging platform Tumblr.com is about to be surpassed in unique visitors by quirky style-wrought upstart Pinterest.com. I know what you’re thinking: these two are in separate categories, with Tumblr falling in the blogging field and Pinterest falling in the personal networking field, but if you’ve ever used either service you’ll know there is a definite common denominator uniting them; personal curation.
Curation means the aggregation and organization of artifacts, and in this virtual context the term’s meaning must be stretched. This brilliant NYTimes article outlines the semantic discrepancy of using this term, but the sentiment of curation holds true for both Pinterest and Tumblr. On either platforms users sit within their own microcosm of content they’ve accumulated themselves, all of which represents their identity and taste, and then, as pertinent media drifts by in the broader nebula of the Internet, users pluck up what they feel fits and they arrange it in their collections. We hoard these curios, we pin them and repost them, and through this act of curation we flay open our imaginations so that it might be arranged in neat little boxes and pleasing formats for all the online world to see and appreciate. As the article’s author Carina Chocano states, “it’s a low-dose visual lithium,” and what it soothes is the human need to see our identities expressed in the metaphorical form.
Depicted above in the comparison of UVs between Pinterest and Tumblr is the shocking ascension of Pinterest over the last two years to come just below Tumblr in the past month, with a mere difference of 1,157,604 uniques between the two (and believe me, this is mere when you’re talking in terms of multi-millions). Taking a look at the average stay (below), tells a different story; Pinterest has been mingling in the range of Tumblr for a while now, and it doesn’t look like the site is losing its attraction anytime soon. This shows the type of fastidious loyalty that has kept Tumblr so near-and-dear in its users’ hearts.
But these two platforms may not be as contentious as the above graphs would have you believe. Looking at a breakdown of the age demographics on either site, Pinterest seems to have a diffused popularity among the age ranges while Tumblr has a definitive hold on the 18-24 range. Simply put, younger people love their tumblrs.
Combined with the loyalty displayed in the relatively high average stay, this is a grandiose investment for the Tumblr. If each user on Tumblr is curating, as the site’s design behooves, then each user is essentially creating a chronology of their fascinations and interest, and this is the sort of wealth that is not easily parted with. Tumblr has thus ensured its popularity, or at least loyalty, as this generation ages, while Pinterest is taking a less focused, though just as effective approach by targeting no age in specific.
The point is that these two sites are not in a battle and should not be viewed as contentious. Instead, the interplay between the two sites will be essential in making sure they don’t develop a mutual exclusion for one another. Pinterest will probably surpass Tumblr in UVs very soon, but Tumblr will not be made irrelevant as a result. In fact, it looks like Tumblr will be around for a long time, so they might as well get used to one another.]]></bodys>

 <bodys><![CDATA[∧Advertising, ∧Internet∧Marketing, ∧design With the many changes to advertising and the way we consume media, it’s perhaps comforting that in light of all the adjustments and new features out there, email marketing is still a tried and trusted way of reaching your audience. But while the format of email hasn’t changed much since it was introduced, how we’re consuming such content has.
With more people looking at their mobile screens as well as desktop, it’s important to adapt your content so that it’s accessible to both audiences.
Focus On The Subject Line
For one, while there are similarities like email headings and such, you will need to consider how long you make the subject header. If it’s too long, it will cut off and if it’s too short, you mightn’t have enough to entice people to open the email. Finding subject lines that meet all criteria is difficult in itself so instead of worrying about all of them, focus on one or two aspects.
Depending on the type of email app you’re using, the character limit could range anywhere from 30 to 50 characters altogether. This puts further restraints on what your subject line is going to be so if it’s between 50 – 70 characters, then the keywords that pulls people in should be at or near the beginning. Placing it near the end means there’s a greater chance of it not appearing, meaning a lost opportunity.
Sometimes it can be difficult to figure out whether your readers will use mobile or desktop, but keeping it shorter will improve the chances of it being read. That ties into the next point.
Know Your Audience
Or in some cases, learn about your audience. When you’re starting off, you will have a rough idea of the demographics you want to reach, but when you’ve already sent out one or two, then your analytics will begin to paint a picture of who’s reading and receiving your emails.
Refer to them regularly – every week would be a good start – to see what devices people are using to read, when they’re opening them and what the CTR is. Using that knowledge is important if you want to improve your service.
Design Is Key
Regardless of what content you put in your email, if it’s difficult to read or fits awkwardly into a mobile format, then you’ve lost your audience. Screens may differ in size, but ultimately they will scale down to the same level. If you’re putting together a newsletter, services like Mailchimp allow you to create templates that work on both mobile and desktop, but if you’re designing a custom version, you will need to do some testing to ensure things go smoothly.
This also includes font size too. Consider what the optimal size is for a good reading experience and place yourself in the shoes of those reading your mail for the first time or send it to some of your colleagues or friends to get an objective opinion and shape it through that.
Touch Vs Click
When you’re reading through an email on desktop, the mouse allows for more specific clicks and easier navigation. Mobile doesn’t have the same practicality since fingers don’t have the same accuracy at clicking as a mouse and the smaller screen only adds to the problem.
Therefore, if you have links or buttons that you want readers to click on, design it so that they’re of sufficient size and are spaced away from other buttons to avoid accidental clicks.
Timing Is Important
It’s no surprise that the same type of rules for normal email applies for mobile email and timing is one that crops up time and time again, and for good reason too. While it will vary with your audience, generally the best times to post it during the working day between Tuesday and Thursday with the afternoon working best. The infographics below from a previous email marketing article we covered will give you an idea of when people send and check their email accounts.
Check Content For Spam
A small but important piece of info to remember before you send a mail out for the first time. If your email is filled with links, your email provider may flag it as spam and filter it into a different section, meaning it’s not seen by your audience. Test out your mail first through services like Email Spam Test to ensure that your email isn’t going to be flagged before you send it.
Set Realistic Goals
While the format is popular, you should bear in mind that the open rate and CTR for email tends to be rather low. People are normally overwhelmed with new arrivals in their inbox that they will either ignore it or quickly scan through the contents. An even smaller percentage will open click on links so brace yourself for potentially lower than expected open rates. Over time, it will build up provided the content you’re placing in it is interesting in its own right.]]></bodys>
