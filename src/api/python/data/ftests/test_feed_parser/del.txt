It comes up during contract negotations between Jack Donaghy (played by Alec Baldwin) and Tracy Jordan (played by Tracy Morgan.) Tracy has quit his job on <em>TGS,</em> so Jack hires a Bill Cosby impersonator named Rick to try to convince him to come back.</p>\n<p>You can watch <a href=\"http://classicajays.tumblr.com/post/103409794462/with-bill-cosby-in-the-news-for-sexual-assault-i\" target=\"_blank\">the full clip here</a>, and read the exchange below:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Jack Donaghy:</strong> I&rsquo;ve arranged for one of Tracy&rsquo;s childhood idols to reach out to him.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracy Jordan:</strong> Hello?</p>\n<p><strong>Jack Donaghy:</strong> Tracy, this is Jack, I have someone here who wants to speak with you.</p>\n<p><strong>Rick:</strong> Tracy, this is Bill Cosby&hellip;</p>\n<p><strong>Liz Lemon:</strong> [whispering] Really? This is your strategy?</p>\n<p><strong>Jack Donaghy:</strong> [whispering and smiling] I heard him do this at a party!</p>\n<p><strong>Rick:</strong> &hellip;I want you to come back to the TGS for the people who like the jokes and the things.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracy Jordan:</strong> Bill Cosby, you got a lotta nerve gettin&rsquo; on the phone wit&rsquo; me after what you did to my Aunt Paulette!</p>\n<p><strong>Rick:</strong> I think you&rsquo;re confusing me with someone else.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracy Jordan:</strong> 1971. Cincinnati. She was a cocktail waitress with the droopy eye!</p>\n<p><strong>Rick</strong>: I&rsquo;m the guy&hellip; with the pudding&hellip;</p>\n<p><strong>Tracy Jordan:</strong> Don&rsquo;t try to tell me what to do! Dr. Heathcliffe Huxtable, wit&rsquo; yo&rsquo; light-ass kids! Jack! Why would you make me talk to this man?</p></blockquote>\n<p>At the time, it was probably easy to overlook this exchange because Tracy was known for spewing total non-sequiturs, telling outlandish stories about his family history and generally being an unreliable narrator. But now that a number of women have <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/timeline-of-the-abuse-charges-against-cosby.html\" target=\"_blank\">publicly accused</a> Cosby of sexual assault, this hardly feels like a throwaway one-off joke.</p>\n<p>Also, keep in mind that in October, former <em>30 Rock </em>writer Hannibal Buress <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/hannibal-buress-called-bill-cosby-a-rapist.html\" target=\"_blank\">publicly called Cosby out</a> in a rant that helped ignite the ongoing national discussion. Granted, Buress began writing for the show after the episode in question aired, so he probably wasn&#8217;t responsible for this scene. But chances are he&#8217;s not the only member of the <em>30 Rock</em> team &mdash; or the comedy community in general &mdash; who has been deeply frustrated for many years about the lack of attention given to the allegations against Cosby.</p>\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s possible that it&#8217;s all a weird coincidence and that this <em>was</em> just another example of Tracy being Tracy.
