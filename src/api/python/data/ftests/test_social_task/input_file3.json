    "content_encoded":"A 12-year-old girl from California has won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after a tense final in Washington. Ananya Vinay from Fresno correctly spelled the word marocain - a type of dress fabric - to defeat Rohan Rajeev, 14, from Oklahoma. The rivals had correctly spelled words including cheiropompholyx, durchkomponiert and tchefuncte as each waited for the other to slip up. But Rohan misspelled the word marram and Ananya got two words right to win. She said she felt 'amazing' after her victory, adding: 'It was just fun to see how far it would go.' Here are some of the words Ananya and Rohan grappled with during their 45-minute spell-off. ",
